COMP117 File Copy Design Document
October 8, 2019

The inital assumption our protocol makes is that it will only try to copy one
file at a time to the server, and will not start to copy another file until
the previous file has copied over correctly. 

Our protocol works with two types of packets. There is an initial packet that 
tells the server that a file is going to be copied. This packet will contain
the full file name of the file that is being copied, the number of packets that 
will be copied for the file, and a checksum of the previous two entries to
ensure that this information is correct. After this initial packet is sent 
and the server sends back a confirmation the rest of the packets will be of 
the same type. This second packet contains a header that has the SHA1 of 
the file name, the packet number of the current packet (as in which number
packet it is in the sequence), a checksum of the entire packet including the
header, and then the rest of the packet is the data from the file. Our packets
are going to be 512 bytes large. Both types of packets will have the first byte
or few bytes be a unique signifier to tell what type of packet it is. 

In the scenario where a packet is received from the client that does not 
match the checksum in the header of the packet, or if the server times out 
waiting for a message from the client and has not received all of the packets
yet, the server will send a message to the client that contains the number
of packet that needs to be sent again.
