<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">What are the highest "nastiness" levels at which you believe your program will
successfully copy an entire directory full of files? (We will test your programs using those levels
on both the client and the server; if all you got working
was the end-to-end check, then please tell us how to test your work. <em>Also: if high network nastiness messes up your ability to deal with file nastiness, you can give us two pairs: e.g. Test my client and server with networknastiness=4 and filenastiness=1 or networknastiness=0 and filenastiness=3)</em></li>
<li class="a">
<!-- replace XX and YY with the actual values -->
Please test my client and server with: networknastiness=3 and filenastiness=0.
</li>

<li class="q">Is there anything else we should
know about testing your code, or what you expect it to do
(beyond what's explained in your report below)?</li>
<li class="a">
No, everything should be explained by the report below.
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
No we did not receive help from any outside person.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
I thought this project was definitely worthwhile because it required a lot of 
prior planning and forethought to be successful. Even though we spent a lot
of time planning out our protocol there were still situations that we had not
considered, highlighting how difficult it is to fully flesh out a functional
protocol.

<h3>What did we do? What worked and what didn't?</h3>
<p>Our implementation of FileCopy can be seen as similar to the implementation
of TCP. It works by checking which packets have been delivered and written to
the new file. Then after all packets have been written there is another end
to end check to fully ensure that the file was written correctly. The thing
that worked best was our invariant that a file will not be copied over until
the previous file is fully copied and checked to be correct. Having this invariant
in place removes the possibility of extraneous packets coming later on and also 
removes confusion for both the server and the client. Another thing that worked was making sure that our writing to the file is idempotent. Initially we had the 
write append the data to the file, but this does not work in cases where packets
are dropped and have to be written again. Instead we used fseek to get to the 
correct place in the file to ensure that the data is always being written to the correct place. This will be further addressed later but the things that did not 
work mostly stemmed from misunderstandings of the spec. We had issues with writing
all of the files on nastiness 0 and still dropping packets, then later realized
that the spec specified that if you write too many packets without receiving them packets will still drop. We would have saved a considerable amount of time if we
had more thoroughly read the instructions.</p>
<h3>What cases does our code handle?</h3>
<p>As of now our code can handle copying of files up to network nastiness 3. 
We have tested this with very large files and the files are still copied relatively quickly.</p>
<h3>Description of our protocol</h3>
<h4>The sequence of packets sent</h4>
<p>In the case where there is no file or network nastiness our client will first
send a packet to the server that tells it which file is being copied along with how
many packets will be read in. This packet serves the purpose of letting the server 
go into a state of continuous reading until all of the packets have been received 
correctly, and also telling the server how many packets will need to be read in.
Next the client reads from the file and divides up the data into the appropriate amount of packets. The client then sends packets to the server, sleeping for a 
quarter of a second every 100 packets to give the server time to read in packets.
From there the server will read in all of the packets, and after receiving each one
it will write it immediately to the correct file. During this writing the server 
keeps track of how many packets are being written to the file with an array that
marks written packets as 1 and non-written packets as 0, so after it is done
receiving packets it knows if it needs to request any more packets. In the case
where all packets were written to the file the server tells the client that it is 
done and that the client can begin the final end to end check. In the case where 
there are some packets that were not written to the file the server loops
through the check-array and requests any packets that are not marked as written.
During this time the client is waiting for a confirmation from the server, so it 
will keep sending requested packets to the server until it is told to start 
the end to end check. Our end to end check works the same as it did in the
preliminary assignment where the client sends a message to the server containing 
the hash of the file, then the server takes that hash and compares it to the hash
of the newly copied file and reports back to the client whether they are the same.
Then the client acknowledges this and the end to end check is completed (under 
our protocol this end to end check should never fail). After all of this is 
completed the client will restart the process for the next file in the directory.
</p>
<h4>Structure of the packets</h4>
<p>There are several types of packets that we will send. The first is the packet that 
is sent to indicate the beginning of the copying of a file. This packet begins 
with a code '8' that indicates what type of packet it is, then is a char array
of length 16 which tells the server how many packets are going to be sent to 
copy the file, and then finally ends with a string which contains the full file
name of the file being copied.</p>
<p>The second type of packet is the data packet that the client sends to the 
server. This packet again starts with a code '9' to indicate its packet type,
then contains a SHA1 hash of the file name of the file being copied, and then
the number packet in the sequence which this is (so that the server knows where
to write in the file and to keep track of the packets which have been received),
then ends with the data which is 399 bytes long. The server then writes this
data to the file and notes that it has been successfully written.</p>
<p>The third type of packet is sent from the server to the client to either
let it know that another packet needs to be sent, or that all packets have
been successfully written. These packets begin with '!' if all packets have
been written, or '@' to request another packet. The '!' packet then also
contains the hash of the file name of the file that is done. The '@' contains
the packet number that needs to be sent again along with the hash of the file 
name.</p>
<p>The last types of packets are those that are sent in the end to end check.
The initial packet begins with a '0' and tells the server to begin an end to end
check and then also contains the filename and a hash of the file itself. The server
gets this packet and compares the hash of the file with the hash of the file in
the target directory and then sends back a packet beginning with '2' if the 
check was successful and '3' if the check failed (and then the hash of the 
file name afterwards). The client responds with an acknowledgment of the success
or failure with another packet that begins with '5' if successful and '6' if
failed, and then the file name. The server responds with a final acknowledgement
packet that begins with '7' and then has the file name.</p>
<h4>Approach to dealing with lost packets</h4>
<p>Our approach to dealing with lost packets is that the server keeps track
of the packets that have been successfully written to the file with an array.
After the client stops sending packets the server goes through this array
to check what packets have not been written and then asks the client for these
packets to be sent again. This process repeats over and over until the server
knows that all packets have been written to the file correctly. This is aided
by the fact that we do not start copying another file until the previous one
is completed, so whether or not packets come out of order does not matter. Also
we use fseek to write to the file, so if packets are sent multiple times or 
sent in the wrong order they will always be written to the same place in the file.
</p>
<h4>Invariants</h4>
<p>As stated before, we do not copy multiple files at once. This invariant helps
us be confident that we are always getting packets from the right file and helps
us to be confident that a file has been fully copied (i.e. we wont ever miss a packet or something). We do also rename the files to have the ".tmp" extension 
that only changes when the end to end check is complete, so once they are renamed
we know that the file copy happened correctly, but as stated before our checks
make sure that this check should always be correct anyway. If the end to end check
could be wrong then we could run into the scenario where we have to figure out
where the errors in the file are, so instead by doing what we do we ensure that
we always know what parts of the file have not been written yet.</p>
<h3>Bugs and Shortcomings</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>What we learned</h3>
<p>The first thing that we learned is to read over the spec many times to make
sure we have a full understanding of it, and then when we have a question or
problem to reference the spec to see if it contains the answer. We spent a 
considerable amount of time confused as to why packets were being dropped
with network nastiness of 0, only to later see that the spec says that
if too many packets are sent without being received some will be dropped. We fixed
this issue by putting a sleep after a certain amount of packets are written. </p>
